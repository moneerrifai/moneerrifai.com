# Biography

Hello :wave:, and thank you for checking out my site!

I am a DevOps engineer who is passionate about cloud, serverless, and python development. 

I currently live in Iowa City, IA with my wonderful wife Emma and our two cats, Mulder and Scully. I work remotely for Infor, and in my spare time I like to blog about tech and help others get into the field.
